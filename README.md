# Terraform / Packer project for scalable self hosted GitHub action runners on GCP üöÄ
This project leverages [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) to deploy and maintain scalable [self hosted GitHub actions runners](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) infrastructure on GCP for a GitHub organization.
* Auto scaling of runners, supporting simple and powerful [scaling policy configuration](#inputs) üß∞
* Fast scaling up thanks to prebuild image via Packer üöÑ
* Support Docker out of the box üèóÔ∏è
* [Cost efficient](#cost) versus [Linux GitHub Runner](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-billing-and-payments-on-github/about-billing-for-github-actions#about-billing-for-github-actions) üí∞

## Setup
To setup the infrastucture, manual steps which can not be done through Terraform must be done:
1. Setup a GitHub App which will be installed in the GitHub organization where self hosted runners will be available. [GitHub setup section](#1-github-setup) explains how to setup this GitHub App
2. Setup a GCP project which will host the self hosted runners and scaling logic must be created. [GCP setup section](#2-google-cloud-plateform-setup) explains how to setup this GCP project
3. Deploy the infrastructure on GCP using Terraform using Packer and Terraform
4. Update GitHup App Webhook setting with GCP project information computed during GCP deployement

### 1-GitHub Setup
This section explains how to setup the GitHub App in the GitHub organization where we want to use self hosted runners. The GitHub App will allow GCP to communicate with the GitHub organization in order to create / delete runners and scaling up / down when needed. Check for [components scheme](#component-scheme) for more information. To be able to properly setup the GitHup App in the GitHub organization, you need to be an admin of this GitHub organization.
* Create a [GitHub App](https://github.com/settings/apps/new):
  * In `Webhook`, uncheck `Active`, and leave `Webhook URL empty for now`. It will be enable in part 4 of the setup.
  * In `Repository permissions` grant `Read-only` permission to `Checks` and `Metadata` (needed to forward scale up event from GitHub towards GCP)
  * In `Organization permissions`, grant `Read & write` to `Self-hosted runners`
  * Check `Any account` for `Where can this GitHub App be installed?`
* From the GitHub App (`https://github.com/settings/apps/{your-app-name}`):
  * Create and store a `client secret` 
  * Create and store a `private key`
  * Store the `app id` and the `client id`
  * Generate, set and store the `Webhook secret`. It will needed for part 4 of the setup.
  * Install the GitHub App in your GitHub Organization using `https://github.com/settings/apps/{your-app-name}/installations`. You will then land on the installed GitHub App web page (the url should look like `https://github.com/settings/installations/{installation_id}`). Store the `installation_id`.

### 2-Google Cloud Plateform Setup
To address a specific GCP projet:
* [Create a GCP project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)
* [Create a GCP service account](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) for this project with the `owner` role
* Download the json key file associated with the service account. You will set it as terraform `variable google.credentials_json_b64`
* Enable [Compute Engine API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/compute.googleapis.com) on the project
* Enable [Identity and Access Management (IAM) API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/iam.googleapis.com) on the project
* Create an App Engine Application at `https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/start?project={your-gcp-project}` with the corresponding zone you want to use in your GCP project

### 3-Deploy the infrastructure on GCP using Terraform/Packer
From now you have everything to deploy the infrastructure on GCP using Terraform and Packer.
For Terraform, you can refer to [inputs](#inputs) to set project [input variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/values/variables.html).
For Packer, you can refer to [Packer json config](https://www.packer.io/docs/from-1.5/syntax-json) located at [runner.json](image/runner.json)

Nevertheless, deploying the infrastructure can be a tedious task, as two tools are involved (Terraform and Packer) and they share a lot parameters.
To ease deploying a set a scripts is available in [tools folder](.tools). From here, `deploy.sh` and `destroy.sh` do as they are named, deploying and destroying the whole GCP infrastructure easely. To use these two scripts you need to store your Terraform variables in files with a specific layout. The scripts will load these variables and use them in Terrafrom and Packer. The layout to use is:
* A `google` tfvars file containing GCP related Terraform variables:
```HCL
{
  "google": {
    "region" : "a-gcp-region",
    ...
  },

  "runner": {
    "total_count" : 10,
    ...
  },

  "scaling": {
    "idle_count" : 2,
    ...
  }
}
```
* A `github` tfvars file containing GitHub related Terrafrom variables:
```HCL
{
  "github": {
    "organisation" : "a-github-organization"
    ...
}
```
* A `terraform backend` tfvars file, passed to Terraform via [`-backend-config` option](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/commands/init.html#backend-initialization)

From now, you can use `deploy.sh`:
```shell
deploy.sh --google-env-file google-env-file.json --github-env-file github-env-file.json --backend-config-file backend.json
```
Other options are available, just run the scripts without params to print the documentation.

After deployement, Terraform will print the `github_webhook_url` needed for [part 4 of the setup](#4-post-deployement-steps)

### 4-Post deployement steps
* Enable the GitHub webhook, from the GitHub App (`https://github.com/settings/apps/{your-app}`):
  * In `Webhook`, check `Active`, and set `Webhook URL` to `github_webhook_url` from [part 3 of the setup](#3-Deploy-the-infrastructure-on-GCP-using-Terraform/Packer)
  * Go to `https://github.com/settings/apps/{your-app}/permissions`, in `Subscribe to events`, check `Check run`
* Enable ghost runner (see [architecture](#architecture) for more info about ghost runner):
  * From `https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudscheduler?project={your-gcp-project}`, execute `healthcheck`
  * Wait the ghost runner to appears `offline` in `https://github.com/organizations/{your-org}/settings/actions`

You are all set!
